Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
Linear - depends on how many nodes in tree

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
Also linear - add item to stack for each node
3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
Linear
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
Linear b/c queue
5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
O(n log n)
6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
Alter the input array? Constant
Our implementation? Linear
